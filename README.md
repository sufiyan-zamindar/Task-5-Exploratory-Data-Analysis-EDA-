# Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This project performs a full Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the famous Titanic dataset using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.

---

# 📚 Libraries Used

-Pandas: Data handling and manipulation

-NumPy: Numerical operations

-Seaborn: Data visualization

-Matplotlib: Plotting graphs

-Warnings: Suppressing unnecessary warnings

---

# 📂 Dataset
-Source: Titanic dataset loaded via seaborn.load_dataset('titanic')

-Contains passenger information like age, gender, fare, class, and survival status.

---

# 🚀 Workflow
-Data Loading and Inspection

-Load the Titanic dataset

-Display basic info and summary statistics

-Check missing values

-Display value counts for categorical columns 

---

# Visual Explorations

-Heatmap of missing values

-Pairplot of selected features

-Correlation heatmap

-Histograms and boxplots for Age, Fare, Class, and Survival

-Countplots and barplots to explore categorical trends

-Observations

-Identify missing data patterns

-Explore relationships between survival and features like gender, age, fare, and class

# Summary of Findings

-Younger, first-class, and higher-fare passengers had better survival chances

-Females had a higher survival rate than males

-Missing values, especially in 'Age' and 'Cabin', require careful treatment before modeling

---

# 📈 Key Visuals
-Heatmaps: Missing values, correlations

-Histograms: Age distribution

-Boxplots: Fare comparison by survival

-Countplots: Class distribution

-Barplots: Gender vs survival rate

-Pairplots: Visualizing feature relationships

# 💡Project Summary
This EDA provides crucial insights into the Titanic dataset, uncovering patterns that can inform predictive modeling efforts. Special focus is needed for missing data, and demographic factors like age, gender, fare, and passenger class strongly influenced survival outcomes.

---

# 🛠️ Future Steps
Handle missing data more rigorously (imputation or removal)

Feature engineering (e.g., family size, title extraction from names)

Model building for survival prediction
